This is the bgt program.  It allows the user to create and maintain a budget simply using only the command-line.
It is relatively easy to use and to master, being built on simple concepts that can be understood quickly.

To build the bgt program, do the following in the source directory:

export CFLAGS="-O2 -s -D_LARGE_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64"
cmake .
make

That should create a program named bgt.  Copy that program somewhere that is accessible in your path, and you
are ready to go.

Do the following to read the man page:

nroff -man bgt.1 |less

Or, copy bgt.1 to a man directory and man will find it automatically, like this:

man bgt

Enjoy.
